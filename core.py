# Grading System with Multiple Ranges
# Write a program that takes a student’s score (0–100) and prints their grade and remark by concatenating the grade and remark:

# 1. students score more than variable
# 2. score is between 0 - 100
# 3. print grade
# 4. print the remark
# 5. join the grade with the string
